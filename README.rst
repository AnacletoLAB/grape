GraPE
===================================
|pip| |downloads|

`GraPE`_ (*Graph Processing and Embedding*) is a fast graph processing and embedding library, designed to scale with big graphs and to run on both off-the-shelf laptop and desktop computers and High Performance Computing clusters of workstations.

The library is written in *Rust* and *Python* programming languages, and has been developed by `AnacletoLAB <https://anacletolab.di.unimi.it/>`_ (Dept.of Computer Science of the University of Milan), in collaboration with the `Robinson Lab - Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine <https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-robinson-lab>`_ and with the `BBOP - Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory <http://www.berkeleybop.org/index.html>`_.

`GraPE`_ is composed of two main modules: `Ensmallen`_ (*ENabler  of  SMALL  runtimE  and  memory  Needs*) and `Embiggen`_ (*EMBeddInG  GENerator*), that run synergistically using parallel computation and efficient data structures.

`Ensmallen`_ efficiently executes graph processing operations including large-scale first and second-order random walks, while
`Embiggen`_ leverages the large amount of sampled random walks generated by `Ensmallen`_ by computing effective node and edge embeddings. 
Beside being helpful for unsupervised exploratory analysis of graphs, the computed embeddings can be used for trainining any of the flexible neural models for edge and node label prediction, provided by `Embiggen`_ itself.

The following figure shows the main relationships between `Ensmallen`_ and `Embiggen`_ modules:

Installation of `GraPE`_
----------------------------------------------

For most computers you can just download it using pip:

.. code:: shell

    pip install grape
    
Since Ensmallen is written in Rust, on PyPi we distribute pre-compiled packages for :code:`Windows, Linux, MacOs` for the Python version :code:`3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9` for :code:`x86_64` cpus.

For the Linux binaires we follow the `Python's ManyLinux2010 (PEP 571) <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0571/>`_ standard which requires libc version >= 2.12, this version was releasted in 03/08/2010 so any Linux System in the last ten years should be compatible. To check your current libc version you can run :code:`ldd --version`.

We also assume that the cpu has the following features: :code:`sse, sse2, ssse3, sse4_1, sse4_2, avx, avx2, bmi1, bmi2, popcnt`. **If these features are not present, you cannot use the PyPi pre-compiled binaries and you have to manually compile Ensmallen** `(Guide) <https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/ensmallen/blob/master/bindings/python/README.md>`_ .
On Linux you can check if your CPU supports these features by running :code:`cat /proc/cpuinfo` and ensuring that all these features are presents under the :code:`flags` section.
While these features are not strictly required, they significanly speed-up the executions and should be supported by any :code:`x86_64` CPU newer than Intel's Haswell architecture (2013).

If the your CPU doesn't support them you will get, on import, a :code:`ValueError` exception with the following message:

.. code:: shell

    This library was compiled assuming that SIMD instruction commonly available in CPU hardware since 2013 are present 
    on the machine where this library is intended to run.
    On the current machine, the flags <MISSING_FLAGS> are not available.
    You could still compile Ensmallen on this machine and have a version of the library that can execute here, but the 
    library has been extensively designed to use SIMD instructions, so you would have a version slower than the one 
    provided on Pypi.


These requirements were chosen to provide a good tradeoff between compatability and performance. 
If your system is not compatible, you can `manually compile Ensmallen <https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/ensmallen/blob/master/bindings/python/README.md>`_ for any  Os, libc version, and CPU architecture (such as Arm, AArch64, RiscV, Mips) which are supported by Rust and LLVM. 
Manually compiling Ensmallen might require more than half an hour and around 10Gb of RAM, if you encounter any error during the installation and/or compilation feel free to open an Issue here on Github and we will help troubleshoot it.

Tutorials
----------------------------------------------
You can find tutorials covering various aspects of the GraPE library `here <https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/grape/tree/main/tutorials>`_. All tutorials are as self-contained as possible and can be immediately executed on COLAB.

If you want to get quickly started, after having installed `GraPE`_ from Pypi as described above, you can try running the following example using the SkipGram embedding model on the Cora-graph:

.. code:: python

    from ensmallen.datasets.linqs import Cora
    from ensmallen.datasets.linqs.parse_linqs import get_words_data
    from embiggen.pipelines import compute_node_embedding
    from embiggen.visualizations import GraphVisualization
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Dowload, load up the graph and its node features
    graph, node_features = get_words_data(Cora())

    # Compute a SkipGram node embedding, using a second-order random walk sampling
    node_embedding, training_history = compute_node_embedding(
        graph,
        node_embedding_method_name="SkipGram",
        # Let's increase the probability of explore the local neighbourhood
        return_weight=2.0,
        explore_weight=0.1
    )

    # Visualize the obtained node embeddings
    visualizer = GraphVisualization(graph, node_embedding_method_name="SkipGram")
    visualizer.fit_transform_nodes(node_embedding)

    visualizer.plot_node_types()
    plt.show()


You can `see a tutorial detailing the above script here <https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/grape/blob/main/tutorials/SkipGram_to_embed_Cora.ipynb>`_, and you `can run it on COLAB from here <https://colab.research.google.com/github/AnacletoLAB/grape/blob/main/tutorials/SkipGram_to_embed_Cora.ipynb>`_.


Documentation
----------------------------------------------
On line documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The on line documentation of the library is available `here <https://anacletolab.github.io/grape/index.html>`__.
Since Ensmallen is written in Rust, and PyO3 (the crate we use for the Python bindings), `doesn't support typing <https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/510>`_, the documentation is obtained generating an empty skeleton package. This allows to have a proper documentation but you won't be able to see the source-code in it. 

Using the automatic method suggestions utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To aid working with the library, Grape provides an integrated recommender system meant to help you either to find a method or, if a method has been renamed for any reason, find its new name.

As an example, after having loaded the `STRING Homo Sapiens graph <https://string-db.org/cgi/organisms>`_, the function for computing the connected components can be retrieved by simply typing components as follows: 

.. code:: python

    from ensmallen.datasets.string import HomoSapiens

    graph = HomoSapiens()
    graph.components

The code above will raise the following error, and will suggest methods with a similar or related name:

.. code-block:: python

    AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-3-52fac30ac7f6> in <module>()
    ----> 2 graph.components

    AttributeError: The method 'components' does not exists, did you mean one of the following?
    * 'remove_components'
    * 'connected_components'
    * 'strongly_connected_components'
    * 'get_connected_components_number'
    * 'get_total_edge_weights'
    * 'get_mininum_edge_weight'
    * 'get_maximum_edge_weight'
    * 'get_unchecked_maximum_node_degree'
    * 'get_unchecked_minimum_node_degree'
    * 'get_weighted_maximum_node_degree'

In our example the method we need for computing the graph components would be `connected_components`.

Now the easiest way to get the method documentation is to use Python's `help <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help>`_
as follows:

.. code:: python

    help(graph.connected_components)

And the above will return you:

.. code-block:: rst

    connected_components(verbose) method of builtins.Graph instance
    Compute the connected components building in parallel a spanning tree using [bader's algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0743731505000882).
    
    **This works only for undirected graphs.**
    
    The returned quadruple contains:
    - Vector of the connected component for each node.
    - Number of connected components.
    - Minimum connected component size.
    - Maximum connected component size.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    verbose: Optional[bool]
        Whether to show a loading bar or not.
    
    
    Raises
    -------
    ValueError
        If the given graph is directed.
    ValueError
        If the system configuration does not allow for the creation of the thread pool.
