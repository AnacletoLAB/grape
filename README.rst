GraPE
===================================
|pip| |downloads|

`GraPE`_ is a fast graph processing and embedding library, composed of two main modules: `Ensmallen`_ and `Embiggen`_, that are able to efficiently scale with big graphs using parallel computation and efficient data structures.

`Ensmallen`_ efficiently loads big graphs and executes graph processing operations including large-scale first and second-order random walks, improving upon the performance of current state-of-the-art graph processing libraries by one to four orders of magnitude.

`Embiggen`_ leverages the large amount of sampled random walks generated by `Ensmallen`_ to effectively compute node and edge embeddings that can be used for unsupervised exploratory analysis of graphs or to train the flexible neural models provided by `Embiggen`_ itself for solving edge and node label prediction problems in big graphs.

How do I install this package?
----------------------------------------------
As usual, just download it using pip:

.. code:: shell

    pip install grape

Tutorials
----------------------------------------------
You can find tutorials covering various aspects of the GraPE library `here <https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/grape/tree/main/notebooks>`_. All tutorials are as self-contained as possible and can be immediately executed on COLAB.

Documentation
----------------------------------------------
Currently the documentation website of the library is being developed.
