# Tutorials
Within [this directory](https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/grape/tree/main/tutorials) you may find tutorials relative to the GraPE library main submodules, [Ensmallen](https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/ensmallen) and [Embiggen](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/embiggen). All the tutorials have all dependencies self-contained and are ready to be run on COLAB.

## Ensmallen tutorials
Here follows the list of the currently available tutorial relative to the [Ensmallen](https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/ensmallen) submodule.

* [Loading a graph in Ensmallen](https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/grape/blob/main/tutorials/Loading_a_Graph_in_Ensmallen.ipynb)
* [First and Second order random walks](https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/grape/blob/main/tutorials/First_and_Second_order_random_walks.ipynb)
* [High performance graph algorithms](https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/grape/blob/main/tutorials/High_performance_graph_algorithms.ipynb)
* [Graph generation](https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/grape/blob/main/tutorials/Graph_generation.ipynb)

## Embiggen tutorials
Here follows the list of the currently available tutorial relative to the [Embiggen](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/embiggen) submodule.

* [Using SkipGram to compute Cora's node embedding](https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/grape/blob/main/tutorials/SkipGram_to_embed_Cora.ipynb)
* [Using CBOW to compute Cora's node embedding](https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/grape/blob/main/tutorials/Using_CBOW_to_embed_Cora.ipynb)

## On new tutorials
If you believe there is need for new tutorials:

### Requesting a new tutorial
If you believe something that should be possible to do with this library is not clear or is altogheter missing in the tutorials and you have no clue how to do it, [do open an issue in the GraPE repository](https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/grape/issues/new) and describe well the desired tutorial.

### Adding a new tutorial
If you believe something that should be possible to do with this library is not clear or is altogheter missing in the tutorials and you know how to do it, [do open an issue in the GraPE repository](https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/grape/issues/new) and describe well the area you want to cover in the tutorial. We will get back to you as soon as possible and try to let you know if it is indeed something missing. Once it is established that the tutorial is indeed missing, please do feel free to fork and [create a new pull request](https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/grape/compare) adding the notebook with the new tutorial. Make sure it has a working COLAB link!
